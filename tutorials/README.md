# TVAE Tutorial

This directory contains `TVAE_tutrorial.py`, a short example script that
builds and trains a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) on a small synthetic
mixed-type dataset. The script demonstrates how to preprocess
continuous and categorical columns, embed categorical inputs, define a
simple VAE in PyTorch and run a basic training loop.

Run the example with:

```bash
python TVAE_tutrorial.py
```

It will print the training and validation losses for a few epochs while
fitting the model.
